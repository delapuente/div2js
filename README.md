# DIV2JS

DIV2JS is a transpiler of DIV2 for the modern web. In experimental stage right now, DIV2JS tries to be a perfect simulator for the DIV2 language.

## Install

Clone the repository and in the root folder install dependencies by typing:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Usage

DIV2JS is starting to be useful. I'm now implementing the standard library,
and migrating the example code that came with the original DIV2. If you want
to see the demos, run:

```bash
$ npm run demos
```

## So, what's next?

In the short-term, I'm working on the following:

- [ ] Implementing the standard library.
- [ ] Migrating DIV2 examples.
- [ ] Typing the code.
